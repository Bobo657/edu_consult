                            This is the most important part of our job, because, the student has now obtained visa to study in a new environment. There is the utmost need to prepare them both psychologically and physically for this environmental and cultural change. Our counsellors advise students on documents to travel with and the need to arrive the airport on time. We also emphasize strong respect for the culture and laws of the host country and warn seriously against plagiarism, which is a major reason why some students do not excel in international studies.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We also make arrangement for your arrival in the study destination. Either in conjunction with the chosen institution or privately we arrange for your settling down comfortably.
